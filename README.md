# Lindenmayer Systems

An interactive web experience for the exploration of the L-Systems using [three.js](http://threejs.org/) 3D graphics library and the Tom Brewe's [lindenmayer](https://github.com/nylki/lindenmayer) in-developement library which allows anonymous functions to be called as productions.

Inspired by the book [The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf) written by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer.
